# Number Guessing Game

A simple Python number guessing game where the user attempts to guess a random number between 1 and 100. The program gives feedback if the guess is too low, too high, or correct, and continues until the user guesses the correct number.

## Features
- **Random Number Generation**: The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.
- **User Interaction**: The user enters guesses, and the program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low.
- **Input Validation**: The program ensures that the user enters a valid integer and handles errors gracefully.
